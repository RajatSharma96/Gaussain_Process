# Gaussain_Process
Gaussian Process Regression used for Ranking of Company's Users
This Repository contains two sets of data file, one for positive labels and another for negative labels, I have used these data files first, for 2-Fold cross validation training and testing of the Gaussain Process Classifier, which result can tell us whether the efficiency of the Gaussian Process model is acceptable or not, and after getting prediction over test set it was found that model yields good result.
After validating the model's efficency by Classifier model we will use Gaussian Process Regression model which will give predicted mean and variance for each user of test set and by mean and variance we can calculate one strong score base on which we can rank users of the company.
